# zuri_animation_lib_team97

This is an animation library project  that allows beginners perform basic web animation using normal language.

The Library allows certain animations like - move_up, move_down, move_left, blink, bounce and fade

It contains a demo that shows users how to apply the animations.

It has an  interactive interface to generate the right combination of code to use 

The documentation is very interactive.

A special feature our Animation website has is that there's an onboarding effect that gives a better clarification on what each section is for.

Unauthenticated users can do the following with it:
- Visit 
the platform to view basic information about it and also
View and Interact with the documentation.

They'd have to register in order to get full access to the site and view more details. 

When the user has registered..he gains full access to the site and is able to do the following 
-Download library
-Embed their code by importing. 
- Save data and come back to download
-View saves,downloads and likes.
-Combine different animations. 


How all these were achieved.
-Firstly ,the designers created a flow chart showing the user flow of Zing.The purpose of the user flow is to identify suitable navigational paths and highlight where they can be improved.

The complete information of the design documentation can be found in the link below:

The design served as a template with which  the developers to used to create the animation library. 

-The front end developers used the CSS Framework( React.js) to build the pages and make them interactive. 

-The backend developers used......
